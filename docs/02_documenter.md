what we need?

ðŸ‘‰ An automatic way to generate documents for code from docstrings.

ðŸ‘‰ If docstrings are not there then document should be genrated by show_doc or  something similar. For example you may not want to put docstrings inside a struct. In this case you have to use this customised function to document the struct.

ðŸ‘‰ Automatically create project readme from a common source

`func img(img_path::String)`

     >Helper function to load image inside markdown

The img function loads image from a path

We will use Publish.jl to build our documentation which will also double up as a website for the project.

For this we will make a call to the `newsite()` function which will generate the basic folder structure for us

""`func newsitegen(configpath::String="../settings.ini")`
	  > generate a new site directory. Takes the seetings.ini file from the project root by default"

let's collect the markdown cells.

This can be done with the `collect_codecells` function in core.j
