md""" ## First steps

Install Nbdev by with the following command --> `add Nbdev`

$(LocalResource("../docs/images/addnbdev.png"))

This will install Nbdev in your global environment.

Create a directory in your local system where you would want to start your work. For example, in your local system 

$(LocalResource("../docs/images/testfolder.png"))

`cd` into this directory now. This will be the place where you are going to place your project. Now open a command prompt from inside this directory and type `julia`, this will launch a Julia shell. Here type `]` to launch the "pkg" prompt and then you can type `activate .` in order to create a restricted environment where you can restrict further installations or else you can skip typing `activate .` and type `import Nbdev followed by Nbdev.new()`. This will create the "docs", "Nbdev", "nbs" and "src" directories in your project root. In addition to these directories the "Manifest.toml", mkdocs.yml" and "Project.toml" will also be created at the project root.

What this means is that you can write reactive tests within the same notebook where you are writing your code. when you run that particular notebook, the affected tests are executed. So, you can write tests as you write your code.

In addition to reactivity you can also take advantage of other goodies in PlutoTests like "time travel" to see the different stages of your code (follow the link to PlutoTests for further details)."""

The table of contents in the default case would be created by mkdocs on the basis of the documents available under the "docs" directory.

If you want to give your own spin to the table of contents then add a config similar to the following in the mkdocs.yml file-->

```

      - Nav1: nav1.md

md"""The first step is to checkin all your project contents to your repoitory. As soon as you push your changes to the remote branch, the github action (placed under "/.github/workflows" creates a new "gh-pages" branch under your project repository, builds the project webpages and pushes the created pages to the ""gh-pages" branch.

If you go to the "Actions" tab in your github repository then you can view the Action under the "All workflows" section. Here, a green tick mark before the action name suggests that all went fine.

Now, go to the Settings tab in your repository, click on Pages menu item from the left menu and in the "Source" drop-down select "gh-pages" as the source and root as the source folder, Click on save.

A detailed step by step description about configuring github pages can be read [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

You project website would be published at the following url --> "<username>.github.io/<project reporsitory name>"
