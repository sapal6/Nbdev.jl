The exported code file automatically has all the code inside the module with the same name as the file.

In order to test how your website looks like, go to the project root and type `mkdocs serve` . This would serve the project documentation to view locally (localhost).

The table of contents in the default case would be created by mkdocs on the basis of the documents available under the "docs" directory.

If you want to give your own spin to the table of contents then add a config similar to the following in the mkdocs.yml file-->

```
nav:
    - Home: index.md
    - Docs:
      - Nav1: nav1.md
      - Nav2: nav2.md

md"""The first step is to checkin all your project contents to your repoitory. As soon as you push your changes to the remote branch, the github action (placed under "/.github/workflows" creates a new "gh-pages" branch under your project repository, builds the project webpages and pushes the created pages to the ""gh-pages" branch.

If you go to the "Actions" tab in your github repository then you can view the Action under the "All workflows" section. Here, a green tick mark before the action name suggests that all went fine.

Now, go to the Settings tab in your repository, click on Pages menu item from the left menu and in the "Source" drop-down select "gh-pages" as the source and root as the source folder, Click on save.

A detailed step by step description about configuring github pages can be read [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

You project website would be published at the following url --> "<username>.github.io/<project reporsitory name>"
